Eigenvector centrality is a way to measure the importance of nodes in a network based on how well they are connected to other important nodes.

### Motivation
The idea behind it is simple: if a node (or person) is connected to other important nodes, it is considered important. For example, if you have only one friend, but that friend is the president of the USA, you're still considered important because your friend is important.

### Problem Statement
In eigenvector centrality, a node's importance (centrality) is based on the sum of the centralities of its neighbors. Essentially, if a node has many important connections, it is also important. This is expressed through a mathematical equation, where the importance of each node depends on the importance of the nodes it is connected to.

### Mathematical Background
The problem of calculating eigenvector centrality for all nodes is connected to solving an "eigenvalue problem." Here, the network is represented as a matrix, and finding the largest eigenvalue of this matrix helps determine the centrality of each node.

### Definition
Given a connected and undirected graph (a network where links between nodes have no direction), the eigenvector centrality is found by solving an equation involving the graph's adjacency matrix (which represents how nodes are connected). The component of the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue tells us the centrality of each node.

### Key Points
- The centralities should be normalized, so the largest centrality is 1.
- Eigenvector centrality doesn't work well for directed graphs, where the connections between nodes have direction.

In short, eigenvector centrality measures how well-connected a node is, not just based on the number of connections, but also on the importance of those connections.

This code computes the **eigenvector centrality** for each node in a graph, represented by an adjacency list. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. **Function Signature and Parameters**
```javascript
function eigenvector(A, maxIter, eps) {
```
- `A`: Adjacency list representing the graph. Each element in `A` corresponds to a node, and the array values inside represent the neighboring nodes it's connected to.
- `maxIter`: The maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run before stopping. This prevents the loop from running forever.
- `eps`: The tolerance level for convergence. It ensures the algorithm stops when the difference between two iterations is small enough.

### 2. **Initialization**
```javascript
let b_ = new Array(A.length).fill(1)
let c_ = new Array(A.length).fill(0)
let e_ = 0
let r_ = Infinity
```
- `b_`: An array initialized with 1s, representing the centrality values for each node. Initially, all nodes are assumed to have the same centrality (1).
- `c_`: An array initialized with 0s to temporarily store updated centrality values during the iteration.
- `e_`: A variable to store the centrality score from the previous iteration, initialized to `0`.
- `r_`: A variable to store the centrality score of the current iteration, initialized to `Infinity` to ensure the loop starts.

### 3. **Iteration Loop**
```javascript
while (Math.abs(e_ - r_) > eps && maxIter-- > 0) {
```
This loop runs as long as:
- The difference between `e_` (previous centrality) and `r_` (current centrality) is larger than `eps` (tolerance).
- The `maxIter` (maximum iterations) has not been exceeded.

### 4. **Start of Each Iteration**
```javascript
e_ = r_
r_ = 0
c_.fill(0)
```
- `e_ = r_`: The current centrality score becomes the previous centrality score for the next iteration.
- `r_ = 0`: Reset the current centrality score for this iteration.
- `c_.fill(0)`: Reset the temporary centrality array `c_` to all 0s.

### 5. **Update Centrality for Each Node**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
    for (let j of A[i]) {
        c_[i] += b_[j]
    }
    r_ += c_[i] * c_[i]
}
```
- The outer loop iterates over each node `i`.
- For each node `i`, the inner loop goes over all its neighbors `j` (from the adjacency list `A[i]`), adding their current centrality values `b_[j]` to `c_[i]`.
- `r_ += c_[i] * c_[i]`: After updating `c_[i]` (the new centrality for node `i`), we accumulate its square into `r_`, which will be used for normalization.

### 6. **Normalization**
```javascript
r_ = Math.sqrt(r_)
for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
    b_[i] = c_[i] / r_
}
```
- `r_ = Math.sqrt(r_)`: Compute the square root of the sum of squares (normalization factor).
- `b_[i] = c_[i] / r_`: Normalize each node's centrality `c_[i]` by dividing it by `r_` and store it in `b_[i]`.

### 7. **Final Normalization**
```javascript
const m_ = Math.max(...b_)
for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
    b_[i] /= m_
}
```
- `m_ = Math.max(...b_)`: Find the largest centrality value in the array `b_` (the highest centrality in the network).
- Normalize all centrality values again so that the largest one is scaled to 1 by dividing each `b_[i]` by `m_`.

### 8. **Return the Result**
```javascript
return b_
```
The function returns the final array `b_`, which contains the eigenvector centrality values for each node in the graph.

### Summary of Steps:
1. Initialize centrality values (`b_`) for each node as 1.
2. Repeatedly update the centrality values by summing the centralities of neighboring nodes.
3. Normalize the centralities after each iteration.
4. Stop when the difference between iterations is small enough (based on `eps`) or after a maximum number of iterations.
5. Normalize the final values so that the largest one is 1.
6. Return the eigenvector centrality values for each node.
