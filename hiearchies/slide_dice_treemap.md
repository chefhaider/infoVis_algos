The **Slice and Dice Treemap** is a way to visualize data where you break up a large rectangle into smaller rectangles to represent different parts of your data. The size of each small rectangle corresponds to the value of that part, such as file size or any other numeric data.

Here’s how **Shneiderman’s Slice and Dice Algorithm** works in simple terms:

1. **Start with a big rectangle** that represents the whole dataset.
2. **Divide the rectangle** into smaller rectangles. The size of each small rectangle is based on a certain metric, like the size of a file in a folder.
3. **Flip the direction of the cuts**:
   - On one level of the hierarchy (like the folder level), you might slice the rectangle horizontally (left to right).
   - On the next level (like individual files), you switch and slice vertically (up and down).
4. **Repeat this process** of slicing in alternating directions (horizontal, then vertical, then horizontal again, etc.) for each level of the hierarchy (e.g., folders, subfolders, files).
5. **Color the rectangles** based on another metric, like the type of file (e.g., documents in one color, images in another color).

### Drawbacks:
- **Thin and elongated shapes**: Because it always slices the rectangle fully in one direction, you might end up with long, narrow rectangles that can be hard to read.

In short, the algorithm recursively divides a space into rectangles, alternating between horizontal and vertical cuts, making it easy to compare parts of a hierarchy but sometimes hard to visualize small items due to the stretched shapes.

Let's break down the two functions, `sliceanddice` and `treemap`, step by step:

### 1. **Function: `sliceanddice`**

This function calculates the layout of the treemap using the slice-and-dice algorithm. It divides a given rectangular space either horizontally or vertically based on the depth level.

```js
/**
 * Compute the treemap layout with the slice and dice algorithm
 * @param {Array} sibling, array of nodes
 * @param {Object} rect, rectangular drawing area
 * @param {Number} depth, depth of the node
 */
function sliceanddice(sibling, rect, depth) {
    let d = 0 // Initialize the offset (starting point for placing nodes)

    // Loop through each sibling (each node in the current level)
    sibling.forEach(s => {
        if (depth % 2 === 0) {  // Even depth: slice vertically
            const w = s.size / rect.height // Compute width based on node size and rectangle height
            s.x = rect.x + d  // Set the x-coordinate of the node
            s.y = rect.y  // Set the y-coordinate (same for all nodes at this depth level)
            s.width = w  // Set the node's width
            s.height = rect.height  // Set the node's height to fill the available vertical space
            d += w  // Move the offset to the right for the next node
        } else {  // Odd depth: slice horizontally
            const h = s.size / rect.width  // Compute height based on node size and rectangle width
            s.x = rect.x  // Set the x-coordinate (same for all nodes at this depth level)
            s.y = rect.y + d  // Set the y-coordinate of the node
            s.width = rect.width  // Set the node's width to fill the available horizontal space
            s.height = h  // Set the node's height
            d += h  // Move the offset down for the next node
        }
    })
}
```

#### Steps for `sliceanddice`:
- The function takes an array of nodes (`sibling`), a rectangular area (`rect`), and the current `depth` in the hierarchy.
- It alternates between slicing vertically (if the depth is even) and horizontally (if the depth is odd).
  - **Even depth**: Slices the rectangle vertically, so each node gets a portion of the width based on its size.
  - **Odd depth**: Slices the rectangle horizontally, so each node gets a portion of the height based on its size.
- The `d` variable tracks the position along the x-axis (for vertical slicing) or y-axis (for horizontal slicing) as we place the nodes.

### 2. **Function: `treemap`**

This is a recursive function that computes the treemap layout for the entire tree by recursively subdividing nodes and applying the `sliceanddice` function to each level.

```js
/**
 * Compute the treemap, recursive implementation
 * @param {Object} tree, tree with main tree functions
 * @param {Object} node, node of the tree
 */
function treemap(tree, node, depth) {
    // Base case: If the node has children, proceed with slicing
    if (tree.hasChildren(node)) {
        const width = node.width // Get the current node's width
        const height = node.height // Get the current node's height
        const x0 = node.x // Get the current node's x position
        const y0 = node.y // Get the current node's y position

        // Define the rectangle for the current node (the available space to be subdivided)
        const rect = { width: width, height: height, x: x0, y: y0 }

        // Get the children (sibling nodes)
        const sibling = node.children

        // Normalize the size of sibling nodes based on the available area
        normalizeArea(sibling, rect)

        // Apply the slice-and-dice algorithm to the sibling nodes
        sliceanddice(sibling, rect, depth)

        // Recursively apply treemap layout for each child node (deeper in the hierarchy)
        sibling.forEach(n => treemap(tree, n, depth + 1))
    }
}
```

#### Steps for `treemap`:
- The function receives the `tree`, a `node` in the tree, and the `depth` of that node.
- **Base case**: If the node has children (meaning it's not a leaf node), the function proceeds.
- **Defining the rectangle**: 
  - The current node’s rectangle is created using its width, height, and position (x, y).
- **Getting the children**:
  - `sibling` represents the child nodes that need to be laid out within the current rectangle.
- **Normalize the area**:
  - This is an external function (`normalizeArea`) that adjusts the sizes of the child nodes based on the available area.
- **Apply `sliceanddice`**:
  - The `sliceanddice` function is called to compute how to position and size the child nodes within the current rectangle.
- **Recursion**:
  - The function calls itself for each child node (`sibling.forEach`), passing the child node and incrementing the `depth` to control the alternating horizontal/vertical slicing.

---

### Summary:

- `sliceanddice`: Slices the current rectangle either horizontally or vertically, depending on the depth, and positions the child nodes.
- `treemap`: Recursively divides the tree into smaller parts and applies the slice-and-dice layout to each part.

This combination of functions allows you to build a treemap by recursively subdividing a given space based on node sizes.
