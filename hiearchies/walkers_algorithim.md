Walker's Algorithm is designed to help us draw trees in a way that looks visually pleasing and easy to understand. Here's how it works, broken down into simpler steps:

### Main Idea:
- The goal is to figure out where each node (a point in the tree) should be placed on a drawing.
- Each node in a tree has a "parent" node and may have "child" nodes below it.
- We want to position these nodes so that the tree looks balanced and clear.

### Aesthetic Rules:
1. **Horizontal alignment**: Nodes on the same level (e.g., all children of a node) should be placed on the same horizontal line.
2. **Order matters**: The children should be drawn in the order they are listed in the tree.
3. **Symmetry**: If you reflect the tree, it should look the same. This helps the tree look balanced.
4. **Centering**: The parent node should be centered directly above its children.
5. **Consistency**: Subtrees (branches of the tree) should look the same no matter where they are placed in the overall tree.

### How the Algorithm Works:
1. **Two-pass process**: The algorithm goes through the tree twice:
   - **First pass**: It goes from the bottom (leaves) up to the top (root). This is called a "post-order traversal." It calculates rough (preliminary) positions for each node.
   - **Second pass**: It goes from the top (root) down to the bottom to finalize the positions. This is called a "pre-order traversal."

2. **Positioning Nodes**:
   - The **y-coordinate** (vertical position) of each node depends on its level in the tree.
   - The **x-coordinate** (horizontal position) is calculated based on the positions of the nodes' siblings and children.

3. **Modifiers**: 
   - For each node, a **modifier** is calculated, which helps adjust the positions of its children. This ensures that nodes do not overlap or collide with each other.
   - These modifiers are added together to adjust the position of subtrees when necessary.

4. **Sibling and Subtree Separation**:
   - Nodes that are siblings should have a minimum distance between them, ensuring they don't overlap.
   - Similarly, different subtrees should have a minimum space between them, but they should still be drawn as close together as possible without overlapping.

5. **Contour Calculation**:
   - To prevent subtrees from overlapping, the algorithm keeps track of the "contours" (the outer edges) of the left and right subtrees. It compares them to ensure proper spacing.

### Complexity:
- The algorithm works efficiently with a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the total number of nodes in the tree.

### Visual Explanation:
Imagine you are drawing a tree on paper. You first give rough positions to all the nodes starting from the bottom, and then you refine these positions as you move back down from the top. Along the way, you ensure that sibling nodes and subtrees don't overlap while maintaining symmetry and proper spacing.

Let's break down the code step by step, block by block:

### 1. **`leftContour(tree, node, modSum, lcMap)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function computes the left contour of a subtree, which is the outer edge of the subtree on the left side.
   - **Explanation**:
     - `modSum` keeps track of the cumulative modifications (shifts in position) as we traverse the subtree.
     - `lcMap` is a `Map` where the keys represent levels (`y` values), and the values store the minimum `x` value (leftmost) at each level.
     - For each node, the function calculates its `x` coordinate plus the cumulative modifier (`modSum`). If that value is smaller than the current value stored in the map for that level, it updates the map.
     - It recursively does this for all the children of the node.

### 2. **`rightContour(tree, node, modSum, rcMap)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function computes the right contour of a subtree, which is the outer edge of the subtree on the right side.
   - **Explanation**:
     - Similar to `leftContour`, but it records the maximum `x` value (rightmost) at each level.
     - The logic is nearly identical to `leftContour`, except that instead of minimizing, it maximizes the `x` value.

### 3. **`centerSiblings(lNode, rNode)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function centers the nodes that are between two sibling nodes (`lNode` and `rNode`).
   - **Explanation**:
     - It identifies all the nodes between `lNode` and `rNode` and calculates an equal spacing between them.
     - `stepSize` is the calculated distance between `lNode.x` and `rNode.x`, divided by the number of intermediate nodes plus one.
     - For each node between `lNode` and `rNode`, it adjusts its `x` position and its `mod` (modifier) field by the calculated offset so that they are spaced out evenly.

### 4. **`contourCollision(tree, node)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function checks for collisions between subtrees by comparing the left contour of the current subtree with the right contour of the left siblings.
   - **Explanation**:
     - It first computes the left contour of the current node's subtree (`lcMap`) and the right contour of each sibling subtree (`rcMap`).
     - It compares the contours at each depth and calculates the necessary `shift` to avoid overlap, ensuring the subtrees are spaced apart by a minimum distance (`treeDistance` + `nodeSize`).
     - If a shift is required, it updates the `x` position and `mod` value of the node.
     - It also calls `centerSiblings` to balance the nodes between the shifted subtrees.

### 5. **`nodesOnScreen(tree, node)`**
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that the tree doesn't go off the screen on the left side.
   - **Explanation**:
     - It computes the left contour of the tree.
     - If any part of the tree is outside the screen (i.e., the `x` value is negative), it calculates a shift and moves the tree rightward by updating the `x` and `mod` values of the root node.

### 6. **`initialX(tree, node)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function calculates the initial `x` coordinate for each node in the tree using post-order traversal (from the leaves to the root).
   - **Explanation**:
     - If the node has children, it recursively computes the initial position for each child.
     - If the node is a leaf and not the leftmost node, it is positioned next to its previous sibling with a minimum distance of `nodeSize` + `siblingPadding`. If it's the leftmost, it starts at `x = 0`.
     - If the node has only one child, it is centered directly above that child.
     - If the node has multiple children, it is positioned at the midpoint between the leftmost and rightmost children.
     - After computing the position, it checks for contour collisions using `contourCollision`.

### 7. **`finalPosition(tree, node, modSum, bbox)`**
   - **Purpose**: This function computes the final positions of the nodes after applying all the modifiers. It uses pre-order traversal (from root to leaves).
   - **Explanation**:
     - It adds the cumulative modifier (`modSum`) to the node's `x` value.
     - It updates the bounding box (`bbox`) to track the minimum and maximum `x` and `y` coordinates across the entire tree.
     - It recursively computes the final position for each child node.

### 8. **`initPosition(tree, node)`**
   - **Purpose**: Initializes the `x`, `y`, and `mod` fields of each node.
   - **Explanation**:
     - It sets the initial `x` value to `-1` and the `y` value based on the node's depth in the tree.
     - The modifier (`mod`) is initialized to 0.
     - It recursively initializes these values for all the children of the node.

---

### Overall Flow:
1. **`initPosition`** initializes the nodes' positions.
2. **`initialX`** calculates the preliminary `x` coordinates using post-order traversal and checks for contour collisions.
3. **`nodesOnScreen`** adjusts the tree if it's off-screen.
4. **`finalPosition`** computes the final `x` coordinates by applying all modifications using pre-order traversal, ensuring the tree fits within a bounding box.

This algorithm ensures that the tree is drawn in a visually balanced way, with minimal overlap and optimal spacing between nodes.
